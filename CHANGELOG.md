### New Features

* Requests timeout
  * New `FAAPI.timeout: int | None` variable to set request timeout in seconds
  * Timeout is used for both page requests (e.g. submissions) and file requests

### Fixes

## v3.7.1

### New Features

* Frontpage
    * New `FAAPI.frontpage()` method to get submissions from Fur Affinity's front page
* Sorting of `Journal`, `Submission`, and `User` objects
    * All data objects now support greater than, greater or equal, lower than, and lower or equal operations for easy
      sorting

### Fixes

* Fix parsing of usernames from user pages returning the title instead
    * Caused by a change in Fur Affinity's DOM

## v3.7.0

### New Features

* Journal headers and footers
    * The `Journal` class now contains header and footer fields which are parsed from journal pages (`FAAPI.journal`)
* Submission favorite status and link
    * The `Submission` class now contains a boolean `favorite` field that is set to `True` if the submission is a
      favorite, and a `favorite_toggle_link` containing the link to toggle the favorite status (`/fav/` or `/unfav/`)
* User watch and block statuses and links
    * The `User` class now contains boolean `watched` and `blocked` fields that are set to `True` if the user is watched
      or blocked respectively, and `watched_toggle_link` and `blocked_toggle_link` fields containing the links to toggle
      the watched (`/watch/` or `/unwatch/`) and blocked (`/block/` or `/unblock/`) statuses respectively.

### Changes

* Remove `parse.check_page` function which had no usage in the library anymore
* Remove `parse.parse_search_submissions` function and `FAAPI.search` method
    * They will be reintroduced once Fur Affinity allows scraping search pages again

### Fixes

* Fix an incorrect regular expression that parsed mentions in journals, submissions, and profiles which could cause
  non-Fur Affinity links to be matched as valid
    * Security issue [#3](https://github.com/FurryCoders/FAAPI/issues/3)

## v3.6.1

### Fixes

* Fix `FAAPI.journals` not detecting the next page correctly
    * Caused by a change in Fur Affinity's journals page

## v3.6.0

### New Features

* Comments! ðŸ’¬
    * A new `Comment` object is now used to store comments for submissions and journals
    * The comments are organised in a tree structure, and each one contains references to both its parent
      object (`Submission` or `Journal`) and, if the comment is a reply, to its parent comment too
    * The auxiliary functions `faapi.comment.flatten_comments` and `faapi.comment.sort_comments` allow to flatten the
      comment tree or reorganise it

* Separate `JournalPartial` and `Journal` objects
    * The new `JournalPartial` class takes the place of the previous `Journal` class, and it is now used only to parse
      journal from a user's journals folder
    * The new `Journal` class contains the same fields as `JournalPartial` with the addition of comments, and it is only
      used to parse journal pages

* Comparisons
    * All objects can now be used with the comparison (==) operator with other objects of the same type or the type of
      their key property (`id: int` for submissions and journals, and `name_url: str` for users)

### Changes

* The `cookies` argument of `FAAPI` is now mandatory, and an `Unauthorized` exception is raised if `FAAPI` is
  initialised with an empty cookies list
* The list of `Submission`/`Journal` objects returned by `FAAPI.gallery`, `FAAPI.scraps`, and `FAAPI.journals` now uses
  a shared `UserPartial` object in the `author` variable (i.e. changing a property of the author in one object of the
  list will change it for the others as well)

### Fixes

* Fix path checking against robots.txt not working correctly with paths missing a leading forward slash

## v3.5.0

### New Features
